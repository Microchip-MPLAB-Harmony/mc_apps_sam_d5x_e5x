# PMSM FOC using Quadrature Encoder

This example application shows how to control the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) with Quadrature Encoder based Field Oriented Control (FOC) on a SAME54 Micro-controller. 

## Description

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is controlled using Field Oriented Control (FOC). Rotor position and speed is determined using quadrature encoder sensor. Motor start/stop operation is controlled by the switch and motor speed can be changed by the on-board potentiometer. Waveforms and variables can be monitored runtime using X2CScope. 

Key features enabled in this project are:

- Dual shunt current measurement
- Speed control loop
- Field weakening


## MHC Project Configurations

![MHC Project Graph](images/Encoder_SAME54.jpg)


- **PMSM_FOC**: 

    This component configures FOC algorithm parameters, motor parameters and motor control board parameters. It connects to underlying peripheral libraries ADC,TCC and PDEC. This component auto configures ADC channels,PWM channels and PDEC peripheral as per PMSM_FOC component configurations. 
- **ADC0-ADC1**: 

   ADC0 and ADC1 are setup to operate in Master - Slave mode with ADC0 acting as a Master

   Both ADCs convert single ended inputs. Phase U current is sampled and converted by ADC0 and Phase V current is sampled and converted by ADC1

   Both ADCs are hardware triggered simultaneously by an event generated from TCC0 at the end of each PWM cycle

   Conversion Ready interrupt is generated by ADC0. Since both ADCs are triggered simultaneously and have the same resolution and sampling time, both ADCs complete conversion at the same time


- **TCC0**: 

    This peripheral is used to generated three phase synchronous PWM waveforms. Fault functionality is also enabled to switch off the output waveforms asynchronously.
- **PDEC Peripheral**:

    It is used to decode the rotor position and speed from quadrature encoder signals.
- **EIC**:

    External Interrupt Controller detects a hardware over-current fault input and generates a non-recoverable fault event for TCC0, thereby shutting down the PWM in the event of an over-current fault
- **EVSYS**:

    Event System acts as an intermediary between event generator and event users

    Event generated by the TCC0 when the counter reaches TOP, is used by the ADC0 as a hardware trigger source via the Event System

    Event generated by the EIC upon over-current fault, is used by the TCC0 as a non-recoverable fault event via Event System
- **SERCOM2**:

    SERCOM2 is configured in USART mode and is set to operate at 115200 bps

    This USART channel is used by the X2CScope plugin to plot or watch global variables in run-time. Refer to X2C Scope Plugin section for more details on how to install and use the X2CScope
- **X2CScope**: 

    This component adds X2C scope protocol code. This uses UART to communicate to the host PC. X2CScope allows user to monitor variables runtime.
- **UART Peripheral**: 

    The UART is used for X2CScope communication to observe graphs and variable values in run time 

## Control Algorithm

This section briefly explains the FOC control algorithm, software design and implementation. Refer to [Application note AN2757](https://www.microchip.com/wwwAppNotes/AppNotes.aspx?appnote=en607365) for the quadrature encoder based sensored FOC technique in detail. 

Field Oriented Control is the technique used to achieve the decoupled control of torque and flux. This is done by transforming the stator current quantities (phase currents) from stationary reference frame to torque and flux producing currents components in rotating reference frame using mathematical transformations. The Field Oriented Control is done as follows: 

1. Measure the motor phase currents. 
2. Transform them into the two phase system (a, b) using the Clarke transformation. 
3. Calculate the rotor position angle. 
4. Transform stator currents into the d,q-coordinate system using the Park transformation. 
5. The stator current torque (iq) and flux (id) producing components are controlled separately by the controllers. 
6. The output stator voltage space vector is transformed back from the d,q-coordinate system into the two phase system fixed with the stator by the Inverse Park transformation. 
7. Using the space vector modulation, the three-phase output voltage is generated. 

**Quadrature Encoder based FOC** :

Rotor position and speed are determined using quadrature encoder sensor. PDEC counts
the decoded quadrature pulses which is the position of the rotor. In this example, counter is a free running counter and software logic is implemented to get the exact angular position from the count. Speed is calculated by measuring the number of quadrature pulses in a fixed time interval. 

Rotor is first aligned to a known position by exiciting either d-axis or q-axis. And then motor is controlled in a closed loop there after. 

The following block diagram shows the software realization of the FOC algorithm.
